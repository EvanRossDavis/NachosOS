We only managed to get Fork, Exec and Yield to work by following the implementation guide.
They can be tested using the tests/ directory.

In order to get it working we modified addrspace to use the Memory Manager bitmap (given from nachos) that we implemented.
	The memory manager was used to keep track of pages using the getPage() and clearPage() functions.
We also implmented a Program Manager in order to keep track of every process that exists. 
	It would have an array of PCBs that were given an ID by the Process Manager which is used to find them later when needed. 
	The idea was whenever a PCB was created it would run the ProcessManager::addProcess() function to add itself to the list.
	Then Kill/Exit would use the ProcessManager::removeProcess() function.
But, we had trouble using the Program Manager in conjunction with the Join, Kill and Exit functions.
